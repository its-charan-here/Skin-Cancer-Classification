The following is the link to the Medium Blog.
The blog will guide you through the execution of Skin Cancer Classification



# Architecture Used:

Tensorflow, <a href =https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientnet/b0/classification/1 >Efficient Net B0</a>



To use other architectures go to the official Tensorlfow website and check image resolution.

# Datset Used:

ICIS Skin Cancer Image Dataset
25,331 Training Images
9 Major categories

But we will be considering only 2 categories that are benign and malignant for the simplicity of this tutorial

Training Image Size: 224 X 224

Example Image:

Benign:
